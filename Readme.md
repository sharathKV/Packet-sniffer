# Packet-sniffer
- In this project, I have developed a packet sniffer tool
- The tool is able to continuously read packets from the raw socket and parse their headers depending on the protocol
- The tool is also able to categorize packets based on protocols and keeps the count of all the packets received
- Protocols considered IP, TCP, UDP, DNS, ICMP, HTTP, HTTPS and QUIC
